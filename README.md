Run index.html to see the visualization of the algorithms.

Some algorithms take a couple of seconds to run after solve is clicked.

Steps to see algorithms

1. Choose a Board and a search algorithm

2. Click solve to run the algorithm and see how long it takes to run

3. Click increment many times to go through the solution step by step or click iterate to view the entire iteration.

index.js contains search algorithms, and other backend elements that help display the visualization

style.css contains style elements for buttons, background, etc.
